# UniFi-LCM-Screensaver
This project reverse-engineers UniFi LCM behavior to recreate its idle particle screensaver. Device state and timing data flow through an animation pipeline that resolves into a particle system, which renders continuously as the final visual output when no higher-priority states are active.
